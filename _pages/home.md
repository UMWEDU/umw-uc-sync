The University Centerâ€™s mission is to provide a campus center that fosters a collaborative and respectful environment where members of the UMW community can engage in their extracurricular and academic pursuits. From a fourth-floor dining center, to a wide range of bookable spaces, and a large ballroom complete with sound and stage offerings, the University Center is a 100,000 square foot facility that can support numerous events and meetings.
